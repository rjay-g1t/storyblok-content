This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## What to Deliver - Answer

**The Basic Idea:** Someone uploads AI-generated text files, and the system automatically creates new pages on your website using Storyblok CMS.

### 1. How We Process Files

When you upload a file:

- The system reads the text and figures out what the title should be
- It creates a unique URL like `/content/some-unique-slug`
- It formats everything properly for Storyblok
- The page goes live on your website

We make sure every page has the same format and good SEO so Google can find it.

### 2. Handling Lots of Files

For big uploads (like 100+ files at once):

- Files get processed in the background so the website doesn't freeze
- We use a queue system so if something breaks, we don't lose your work
- The system waits between uploads so we don't overwhelm Storyblok's servers

### 3. What Could Go Wrong and How We Fix It

**Problem: Storyblok might reject too many requests at once**

- Solution: We slow down and retry automatically

**Problem: AI text might be poorly formatted**

- Solution: We clean it up and check it before publishing

**Problem: Two files might try to use the same URL**

- Solution: Every page gets a truly unique URL. Although my current implementation doesnt check for an existing one but we can have a quick check for this to produce unique URL.

**Problem: The system crashes during a big upload**

- Solution: We save progress and can restart where we left off
